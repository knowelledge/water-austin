# Water you building in Austin?

The goal of this project is to predict residential and commercial water consumption based on building permit data for Austin, TX. By understanding the relationship between metrics of urban development across city tract areas and water usage, resource management planning can be improved for future growth leading to efficiency gains. The impact will be better insight of what drives water demand as well as potential strategies for mitigating scaling aspects of those growing pains given limited resources.
