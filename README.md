# Water you up to in Austin?

This project is trying to predict residential and commercial water consumption based on the city's building permit data. Understanding how water demand in various tract areas of Austin is driven by metrics of our city's development and growth allows for better resource planning and provides targeted insight for efficiency efforts.

Question 4: Who cares? If you're successful, what will the impact be?


## Background

How has this problem been solved before? If you feel like you are addressing a novel issue, what similar problems have been solved, and how are you borrowing from those?


## Methodology

What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?
My approach uses building permit data to better predict future consumption.

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Presentation

How will you present your work?
•	Web app - where will you host it, what kind of information will you present?
•	Visualization - what final visuals are you aiming to produce?
•	Presentation - slides, interpretive dance?


## Data Sources

What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?


## Potential Problems

What are potential problems with your capstone, and what have you done to mitigate these problems?


## Next Steps

What is the next thing you need to work on?
•	Getting the data, not just some, likely all?
•	Understanding the data?
•	Building a minimum viable product?
•	Gauging how much signal might be in the data?
